# deckgl-typings
TypeScript declaration files for deck.gl

This is a work in progress - see the [issues list](https://github.com/danmarshall/deckgl-typings/issues)

```
npm install
```

These will automatically appear in your projects `node_modules/@types` folder, thanks to [indefinitely-typed](https://github.com/danmarshall/indefinitely-typed#readme).
